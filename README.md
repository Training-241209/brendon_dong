# Hello, welcome to my Revature Repo!
~my, referring to Brendon Dong~

I couldn't really quite get Git submodules working, and at the point that I was trying, I had already pushed my code as a separate repo under my own account.

So... how about I just link to it in this README instead? Might as well plan to do that for future projects and save me some headache, unless I get told to do otherwise.
