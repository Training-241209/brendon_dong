# Hello, welcome to my Revature Repo!

I couldn't really quite get Git submodules working, and at the point that I was trying, I had already pushed my code as a separate repo under my own account.

~So... how about I just link to it in this README instead? Might as well plan to do that for future projects and save me some headache, unless I get told to do otherwise.~
I got told otherwise. Why didn't I just start p1 in a separate branch in the first place! That keeps everything clean, though I guess it won't be immediately visible.
Feel free to navigate to it normally or use the redirect link... I guess it's still a redirect link that just links within the same repo, so the previous strikethrough text is still valid. Oh well!
