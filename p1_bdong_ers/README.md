# Project 1 - ERS

This is a **Java Full Stack Employee Reimbursement System (ERS)**. The  ERS centers around Employees submitting Reimbursements that can either be accepted or denied by Managers. It is made using:
- ~~React-Based Front end (talks to backend via HTTP)~~ (It WILL be. Eventually. Not yet.)
- Spring-Based Back End
- Local Postgresql database

<hr>

**Employees using the application can:**

- Create a new Reimbursement

- See all reimbursement tickets (only their own)

- See only their pending reimbursement tickets

- Update an existing reimbursement's description or amount.


**Managers using the application can:**

- See all reimbursements

- See all reimbursements of a given status

- Resolve a reimbursement (update status from PENDING to APPROVED or DENIED)

- See all Users

- Delete a User and any related reimbursements

- Update existing user information, including role

*Managers can do anything Users can do. No need for role checks on User functionalities.\**

\**Managers cannot spoof reimbursements and submit them in other people's names as of the current implementation. Makes sense to me at least? If this is considered bad, can be easily changed back.*


**Users who are not logged in to the application can ONLY:**

- Attempt to log in

- Register for a new account (create new User)
